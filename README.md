# Pong Clone Example Game

A pong-clone game built to play around with writing a game in
[`julia`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia) using
[`SDL2`](https://www.libsdl.org/).

Currently uses my own hacked-up version of `SDL.jl`. Uses `build_app.jl` from
NHDaly/build-jl-app-bundle to compile and bundle a macOS application from the
julia code. (Although this part is still not working.)
